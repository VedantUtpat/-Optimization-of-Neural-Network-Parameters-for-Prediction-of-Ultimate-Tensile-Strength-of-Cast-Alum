# -Optimization-of-Neural-Network-Parameters-for-Prediction-of-Ultimate-Tensile-Strength-of-Cast-Alum
In this project, taguchi method is used to optimize the neural network parameters. These optimized parameters are used to develop neural network model for predicting the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) of Cast Aluminum alloy. To optimize the network parameters, L16 orthogonal array (OA) is developed for 3 parameter 4 level (4^3) and 3 parameter 2 level (2^3) using Minitab software. For this L16 OA, 16 runs are taken to develop the models and 16 different models are trained and evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). This study is carried out to define the best suitable combination of Network parameters.
